[Intro]
In the water, holding hands
Nina knows why, Nina knows why
Fuck these people
Fuck these people, I'm not here

[Chorus]
You’re making me feel like a dollar in your hand
You're making me feel like I'm a zero dollar man
You’re making me feel like a dollar in your hand
You're making me feel like I'm a zero dollar man

[Verse]
I was (I was staring at the water)
I was staring at the water
I had one hand on my head between you and the water
I had one hand on my head in the water
I had my hand over my mouth
And I watched the moon ovеr New Jersey
I had

[Chorus]
You'rе making me feel like a dollar in your hand
You're making me feel like I'm a zero dollar man
You're making me feel like a dollar in your hand
You're making me feel like I’m a zero dollar man



[Outro]
God is real, God is real
I’m not kidding, God is actually real
I'm not kidding this time
I think God is actually for real
God is real, God is actually real
God is real, I wouldn’t joke about this
I'm not kidding this time
