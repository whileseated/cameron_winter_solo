Nina + Field of Cops
____________________

[Verse 1]
Your building is full of people who hate you
And bite off fingers and eat from piles
And someone's knocking
All things spit towards and stutter at you
Closer and closer until the whole city falls over
While the music breaks a window
You're suspicious of treasures and plastic covers
All things flop over, the oven is open
And the kitchen is lying
My name is gonna sound old to you
But names are donuts on the sea
Names are peanuts in the trees
Names bid you to beg for trash
Oh, I walk on everything
On lucky dollars, baskets in thе sand
Sunglasses in the rain, tire tracks in cavеs
I'll never send one more empty box
I'll talk to every crowded room
I'll go to the great carnivals of pain
And fight entire fields of cops
And keep a coconut in my hand

[Chorus]
Nina knows the reason, and she's seen into the mouth
Of what it is to be a mountain
And she's seen all the good pigeon-like people shot down
And bones be kicked to powder by the insane wild horses
Nina I'm not nothing, but when you lie on the piano
I am reminded I am stupid, and in every upstairs room
A tall and daughterless Russian is kicking robins eggs to powder
While the music breaks a window

[Verse 2]
Cavemen are kissing, walking on logs
Low enough to limbo cobwebs
And watch the clouds blow away
Drunk driving towards the sea
I'll be at your feet in every lifeboat
I'll hold these lemons in my mouth and run
One of the important people standing on your chest
I'll love whatever kicks me hardest in the mouth
I'm gonna eat my keys
I've met a little bit of who I am
Backpacking upon the fingers of the real
Barricading every garden gate
Smiling into every cup of grapes
I safari across the neighbor's yard
Pushing groceries past pyramids of teeth
With my hands on my hips
Oh, this idiot festival, I man these cornfields for the banana-growing masses
Getting naked on the plane, sunburned to shit in the rain
Tomatoes in the missing barrels all have met many-handed boys
With laughing brains and know gorilla-fingered yapping dogs
The ugly kidney-needing kitten sees that the empty chairs want somebody

[Chorus]
Nina isn't listening and she's seen into the mouth
Of what is really in the fountain
And she's seen all the good pigeon-like people shot down
And bones be kicked to powder by the insane wild horses
Nina I'm not nothing but when you check under cabinets
I'm reminded someone's calling
And in every upstairs room a dirty old man is blushing
And the neighbors lose their power while the music breaks the window

[Verse 3]
These great spirals, diagrams, and vegetables and talking red trees
Throw it all away
Stupid paper gifts offered with both hands are
Sadder than bald-headed haircut dreams
Sadder than a paper-flat puppy in your pad
Sadder than any featherless doer of math
Sadder than the sad
Microwave everything, add to the puddles
Give me an answer, die for baseball
Motorcycle made of rocks eat this hotel key and ride away
Stuff these papers down your pants
And do the sole survivor's walk back down the way you came

[Chorus]
Nina knows the reason that she's seen into the mouth
Of what it is to be a mountain
And she's seen all the good pigeon-like people shot down
And bones be kicked to powder by the insane wild horses
Nina, I'm not nothing but when you lie on the piano
I am reminded I am stupid, and in every upstairs room
The deep and smiling voice is shushing
Kicking everything to powder
Throwing music out the window
Woah, woah
