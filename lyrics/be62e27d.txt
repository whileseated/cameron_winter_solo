Try as I May
____________

Try as I may
I'm still fighting for you
In my own long-suffering way
You were meant to watch
My private ceremonies
All in the dark parts of rooms

Try as I may
To hold your crazy ass against the wall
In my scared, my scared-shitless way
You came down to see
My private ceremonies
All on the floor of this room

Try as I may
I am always kept safe
In my, in my right minded hell
You were born to hold
My cannonball brain
Like the Lord holds the moon

Try as I may
I never did seduce the wall
With my spinning and my swinging and spineless ways

Try as I may
I'm still fighting for you
In my sad, sad little rock-throwing way
You were meant to watch
Over my ceremonies
All from the dark in my shoe

Try as I may
To be heard through the wall
To be seen getting loud on the phone
You were born to break my big hairy football arms
Like clean windows kill the birds

Try as I may
I am bitching to the wall
Of my long-armed and knuckle-scraping ways
I hadn't sailed 30 feet
When I drowned in expensive clothes
For the oysters all to see

Try as I may
To love what fits in my hand
I don't, I don't
