Drinking Age

I don't know if I'm
Ever gonna stop
Reminding myself
Everything is lying
Today I met who I'm gonna be from now on
And he's a piece of shit, yeah

Wallet on the ground
Bag of rubber bands
Everything is lying

From now on this is who I'm gonna be
This is a piece of me
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh no
(Lip whuffling)
Oh my my my
