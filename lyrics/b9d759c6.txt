If You Turn Back Now
____________________

Lyrics from Live Performance

If you turn back now, I might call out your name
And if you turn back now, I might just turn away
If you turn back now, I might carry you home
And if you got good news, I might hang up the phone
If you turn back now, I might just watch you go
I might love you again if you leave me alone

The devil will work even in the rain that is pouring
The devil's work begins early every morning
The devil is real and he's living in heaven
The devil will love you to death if you let him
The devil will argue, he will beg you to stay
But I belong to he who gavе me away

The beachеs will boil, and the baskets will burn
The sun will come down on your tail as it turns
The sun will stare down on the street where I buy
The milk that is sold the day after you die

And the seesaws will swing on a cold Saturday
And I will love you who has so little to say

You're trying to hear what they're whispering but you don't
There's a whispering that dies wherever you may go
You're trying to know who to want but you can't
There's a lover you pass by with lips in his hands
And you're trying to win back my heart but you won't
My heart is for those who leave me alone
