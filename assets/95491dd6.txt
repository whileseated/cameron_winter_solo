Nausicaä (Love Will Be Revealed)
________________________________

I wanna know
Tell me how it feels
Nausicaä, Nausicaä
I wanna know you

Tell me how it feels
Disappeared
Watching from the side
You can't smoke here
Running of the bull
I'm feeling around
Spinning of the wheel
I'm feeling for the pipe to go down
Love will be revealed, yeah

(Ooh, Nausicaä, I wanna know you)

Tell me how it feels
Someone's here
Watching from the wings
Someone knows I'm here
Running of the bull
I'm feeling around
Tell me how it feels

Love will be revealed (Love will be rеvealed)
Love will bе revealed (Love will be revealed)
Love will be revealed, yeah

I am blind and you are ugly
It's so easy to want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

Running of the bull
Feeling around
Love will be revealed
Walking really slow
Watching from the side
I wanna know you, baby
Tell me how it feels
Love will be revealed, Lord

Nausicaä, Nausicaä
Nausicaä, Nausicaä
Nausicaä, Nausicaä
Nausicaä, Nausicaä
Nausicaä, Nausicaä
Nausicaä, Nausicaä
