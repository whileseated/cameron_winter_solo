Love Takes Miles
________________

[Verse 1]
Love will call
When you've got enough under your arms
Oh oh, mama
Love will call
Love will make you fit it all in the car
Oh oh, mama
Something will take you
By your pants, and
Swing you over his head and kick you back and forth

[Refrain]
Watching the bells, watching the lights
What I want is far away
Talk to the moon, flatten her down
Make her watch the wind all night, she can wait
Lonely as hell, walking around
Without moving, I'm not here
Watching the moon, writing it down
Love takes miles (Love takes miles), love takes years

[Verse 2]
You left me promising your shoes
Mhm, mama
I need
I need your feet more than you do
Mhm mhm, mama
I need somebody sent down from the sun
That talks to me how you used to

[Refrain]
Lonely as hell, feet on the ground
What I want is on my mind
Open the moon, flatten her down
And sit her on the stairs all day, she's alright
Lonely as hell, walking around
Without moving, I'm not here
Watching the moon, everything's down
Love takes miles (Love takes miles), love takes years

[Outro]
You better start a-walking babe
Love takes miles
You better start a-walking babe
Love takes miles
Ooooo, ooo-ooo-oooo
Ooooo, ooo-ooo-oooo
(Love takes miles)
