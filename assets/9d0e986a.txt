It All Fell In The River
________________________

In the chamber-head with her
I came with my stone
I came hanging a feather
In between my bones
It all fell in the river and I came home
It all fell in the river and that's why I came home

I had your rib on my shoulder
Beside your death on the shelf
It all fell in the river
And it sank like little bells, little bells
And now all I have left I have all to myself
All I have left I have all to mysеlf

It all fell in the river
And I didn't ooh thеn
But I'm oohing now
'cause I'm remembering that I'm red
I'm remembering when what fell in the river once fell on my head
What all fell in the river once fell out of the sky and onto my poor head

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Mhm

It all fell in the river
And very easily passed
And what didn't fall in the river
I abandoned on the grass

It all fell in the river and the tears fell at last
It all fell in the river and the tears fell at last
The tears fell at last
