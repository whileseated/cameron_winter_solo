David
_____

As David turned the dial
His smiling king smiled
And as David turned away
The king said please stay
The king said David after tonight
There'll be nothing left to say
But I don't say anything
I don't say anything when my heart breaks

David is an idiot
But even he knows the way home
Even idiots like David often lie awake all alone
And I know darkness often falls when David often goes
But I'm not going anywhere
I'm not going anywhere
I'm not going anywhere when your horn blows

David looked down and he stumbled around
And David looked at me but he stumbled over to you
And you stumbled to that open window
The same one David fell through
And I don't tell anyone
I don't tell anyone
I don't tell anyone where it is I go stumbling to

Sam asked me, "why goes your love so high
And goes mine so low?"
I said "Sam, I don't know
Why my love goes towards David or anybody anyway"
And I don't like anything
I don't like anything
I don't like anything in the first place
