Please
______

You can stay with me
You can stay with me and nobody would care
You can stay with me
You can stay with me and pretend you're alone

Like a sailor in a big green boat
Like a sailor in a big green coat
You can be free
You can be free and still come home
It's alright

You can change
You can change, you can change, you can change
You can change, you can change, you can change
You can change and still choose me

Like a sailor in a big green coat
Like a sailor in a big green boat
You can be free
You can be free, just come home
Please
It's alright
It's alright
It's fine
