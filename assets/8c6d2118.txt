Your Enemy
__________

If you’re looking for your enemy, look no more
If you’re looking for your enemy, look no more
If you’re looking for your enemy, you’ve met your enemy before

Your enemy will wake up so early and work so hard
Your enemy will wake up so early and work so hard
Your enemy will say to you "I know who your enemies are"

Your enemies are not who lies dead when the battle is won
Your enemiеs were striking poses whеn they fired their guns

Your enemy is not the devil in disguise
Your enemy is not the devil in disguise
Your enemy is the angel with a plank in his eye

Your enemy is never gonna kick your mind
Your enemy is never gonna ever kick your mind
Your enemy will tell you something anyone could get behind

You cannot know your enemy by the way they shake your hand
You cannot know how high the moon by the way the raindrops land

My enemy lives in a birdhouse and fights like hell
My enemy lives in a birdhouse and fights like hell
My enemy’s heroes and mine live at the same hotel



When you meet your enemy, cut them in half
When you meet your enemy, my friend, you better cut them in half
And when you meet your hero, lock your lips together and laugh

Your enemy is not your friend, he is your lover
Cause when you jump into the grave, you’ll be jumping on top of each other

You said you know who I am, I make no mistakes
You said you know who I am, I make no mistakes
I said "I know who you are, you’re that coward who doesn’t show his children his face"

You said you know who I am, I make no mistakes
You said you know who I am, I make no mistakes
I said ‘yes, you must be my enemy if that’s the case’

You said "we are not enemies, you must know who I am, you must know who I am"
I said ‘I know who you are, father — I'm your son, not your friend.’
