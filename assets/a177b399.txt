Can’t Keep Anything
___________________

Walking and walking
Walking and walking
Walking and walking you used up your feet
Begging and praying
Begging and begging
Begging and praying you use up your knee

I see where you're going
I see where you're going
Baby where you're going there's nothing you can keep
Baby where I’m going you can't keep anything
You can't keep anything except me

Dying and dying and
Dying and dying and
Dying and dying you used up your dying day
Dying and dying and
Dying and dying and
Dying and dying you used up your grave

I see where you're going
I see where you're going, babe
I see where you're going, babe
I'm going too
Baby where I'm going I can't keep anything
I can't keep anything, not even you

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah

I don't know where I'm going (I don't know where I'm going)
I don't know where I'm going, babe (I don't know where I'm going)
Wherever it is I'm going, baby
You're going too
Baby, where I'm going
I can't keep anything
But I can't just give everything away
I can't just give everything away
I can't just give everything away to you
Okay
