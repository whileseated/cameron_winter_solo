[Verse 1]
We're not gonna wake up whoever's sleeping upstairs
We were born to be quiet
Nobody cares
I have known fingers
I've loved a lot of left hands
We were born to be hairs on the ass of a very busy man

[Chorus]
Ten in the morning, look at him run
Look out Miami cus here I come
Look through the kitchens and kiss him for luck
Let's kiss the baseball that nobody throws
Let's find the lord and beat out everything he knows
Let's go as far as ten dollars can go

[Verse 2]
She was born wearing that hat
She was born with all her teeth
She was born already leaving
She was born to leave
I saw her dance for her coat
I saw her dance a disgusting ballet
I saw her dance a rainbow
Pants-less in the rain



[Chorus]
Ten in the morning, look at him run
Ten in the morning and my masterpiece is done
Let's come up with names for the locks on the doors
Just look upon my shame, look on the floor
Let's find the lord and beat out everything that fucking bastard knows
Take acid with me tomorrow
We're not always gonna have each other
But we're always gonna have tomorrow
In the future
Yeah, we're livin' in the future
Yeah, baby, I'm a-done for the day
