[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
Didn't I say?
Didn't I tell you?
So long and so often
This house is falling apart
And you don't give a damn

[Verse 2]
Can't you see, I am a fortress
Open your mouth, what do you wanna say
I keep killin' your soul with my coldness
The young spirits, they wither away

[Verse 3]
An old, old man is forever a coward
We live in dangerous times
And this land is fallin' apart

[Verse 4]
No courage and no wickedness
You are a body left unspoken
No longer young, no longer Godless
Cursed with a life with you alone
Too late to live with my heart open
I feel loneliest when I'm with you
Too late to live with my heart broken
I feel loneliest when I'm with you
I feel loneliest when I'm with you, babe
I feel loneliest when I'm with you
