Take It With You
________________

[Verse 1]
You can walk as far east as the map goes
Or further west than walked the pioneers
You can sail down south where the chocolate trees grow, mm
But you can't stay here

Cowboy north 'til you reach the Dakotas
Ride the highways in your Cadillac
You could make a fortune panning gold in Sarasota
Just don't come back

[Refrain]
I found a keepsake of you by the window in the kitchen, babe
Take it with you when you leave

[Verse 2]
If you ever get the ache some cold December
To knock again upon your old front door
If you're aching to come home, remember
It's not here anymore

Your travelling companion will be memories
You can lie awake with thoughts of simpler times
You can love me from afar if that's what puts you at ease
But you won't be on my mind

[Refrain]
I found a keepsake of you in that old wardrobe in the cellar
Take it with you when you leave
