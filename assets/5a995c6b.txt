Sandbag
_______

Laying on the ground, leg in the sky
Scratching away, easing my mind
I finally found my truest little part
It's a strange little itch with nothing inside

I sailed on the court calling cows by their name
I inhaled the hot wind and took ship to LA
And I failed to become that beer-barrel love
But won't you love me for the attempt I have made

I will not reach so reachingly out at what yours
I will not beg to be your second or your third
And I will not yell so needingly out at what passes
But won't you please see, it passes in front of me
Bird, after bird, after bird

I finally found my truest little part
And in my heart, thеre's not even a sandbag
