I Will Let You Down
___________________

When the cats are in heat, and the sky is all brown
And you need my hand to hold
I will let you down
When you bump your bald head on the cold riverbed
And you need a guardian angel
She will watch you drown

As you wake up hot and hogtied, and you pray your old sail rises
May your hound-dog enter starving
May it chew away your two old useless prizes
May I live to see your mailmen all break you by the billions
And if they do not break you
May you live to watch all your horses jump from buildings
And may Jesus lay his foot on the back of your head
As your seasick one eyed cat stands there laughing
With her tail wrapped around your neck
And as you drown in that river I'll be having a smoke
With your guardian angels
In the sand making love and cracking jokes

When you're bloody and naked and the mirror's upside-down
And the cats are in heat and the sky is all brown
I will let you down
Yeah, I will you down
I will let you down

I will let you down
I will let you down
