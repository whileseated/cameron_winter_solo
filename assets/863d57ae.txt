I Don’t Wanna
_____________

I can do so many things but I don't wanna do them anymore
I know I'd promised you I'd sway but I never really swore
And I know, I know that you gotta go soon
But I really, really, really don't wanna do
Anything that we haven't already done before

Your light was on bright and I just knew it, I find you suffering so loud
Your hands held hard to ruin into your silverback howl
And I know, I know you gotta go soon
But I really, really, really, really don't wanna do
Anything we can't do right now

From the tower, the tower, scribblin with your tear
Everybody's getting somewhere, get over here
I know, I know you gotta go soon
I really, really, really don't wanna do
Anything that wasn't your idea

Yeah, you were never wrong to misunderstand
To look at it too long and mistake me for a man
And I know, I know, I know you really gotta go soon
I really, really, really don't wanna do
Anything you don't really wanna command

I wanna stand up all stoic down where your barbed wire melts
Let fall all falsely ruined, you can do it all yourself
Oh I know, I know you really gotta go soon
And I really, really, really don't wanna do
Anything, anything, anything, anything at all
With anybody else
