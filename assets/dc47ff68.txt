Emperor XIII In Shades
______________________

Your emperor's finger freezes
Before the lovesick mind
Your emperor gets off his pony
To meet us for the 57th time
I thought there's just enough to feed us
Between your emperor and mine
He says it's too bad what happened to Jesus
But John's tears taste like wine

I woke up on horseback
Not so very late at night
You barked into the black
And I saw the city sitting on its side
You took me down to the track and you drove me down
And you told me you werе never gonna let mе dry
You told me where I told you please don't
It's too bad what happened to Jesus
Thank god our Friday evening survived

The vandal with no sandals
He spilled his fucking sponges on my feet
Everybody knew what to do
Go home, turn on a candle and light a TV
Everybody howls and wheezes
They were pointing at Peter's fallen 
Everybody saying "what happened to Jesus
Ought to happen every couple of days"

The beach ball cathedral
Was dimpled like a sea fly swarming
You were downstairs fighting with people
Round where the apple trains come a-roaring
And the birdhouse in the palace
Kneel down in the noon-time rain reforming
I don't like what happened to Jesus
But I sure do like Saturday morning
