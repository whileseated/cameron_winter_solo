I Have Waited in the Dark
_________________________

I have waited here a really long while
I have stood whistling with my clothes in piles
I've gone on living in a killer's clan
I've gone on living in a killer's dead hand
I've waltzed unwounded one too many miles
I have waited here a really long while

Everybody seems to understand
Everybody puts two pennies in my hand
Everybody gestures into the dark
Everybody's breaking wind in the dark
In the dark you can only listen to the band
In the morning you can only wait 'til it's dark again
And I have sinned in the dark
Yeah, I have said it
Everybody understands but you get it
