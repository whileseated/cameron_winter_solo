It’s Being Waited For
_____________________

I believe that I need no reason to believe anymore
I believe somewhere always being waited for
Alone in the clique
Alone beneath the birds of prey
Alone under the moon
Alone in the sun
And I don’t want to even suck the wound
You'll know why you wait very soon
But it's being waited for

And it may be now that I don’t remember anymore
But I remember how I only once waited in her open half door
And I looked closely
And I melt down very, very slowly
As I made to stand
But she only cleared her throat
Yeah, she only moved her hand
And then I was alone
O man, it’s being waited for

She got to heaven on a fantastic platform
She stepped out into heaven with a long pigeon stoned clarinet cord
She got to heaven
Always pretending to pray
She got to heaven always waiting in line and saying
“Everything's gonna take as long as it’s gonna take”
She got to heaven and she made good time
It's being waited for

It’s a lot of things that tremble at the ends of their long cords
And it's a lot of trembling things that I don't really look at anymore
It's the long man
Picking up the last little sign of life only to drop it into its right bucket
But even with an evil puppet
I believe there is a milkman we have in common
It’s gonna come soldered
It’s being waited for

All tattooed, with nothing on at the zoo, hysterical
What else is there to even do?
In the ice-cold lights of miracles
I’m telling you, it’s being waited for
It’s being waited for
