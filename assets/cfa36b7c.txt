Noah
____

Noah stood beside his pigs
As they watched the moon get big
They watched the rain start coming down
And they watched all the other pigs all drown
Noah thanked god for the rain
It washed those evil pigs away

Oh oh oh

Noah stood beside his horses
They watched the flying of the corpses
The horses wished for corn and sun
The horses wished to roll and to run
Noah only kneeled down and prayed
For another night of rain

Oh oh oh

Noah stood beside his wife
While the wind gnarled like a knifе
She said "once the world is rid of lovеrs
We’ll share the whole world with each other"
Noah’s eyes sparkled and they shone
And he said "the worlds gonna be mine alone"

Oh oh oh

Noah stood beneath the sky
And heard his children singing sigh
Saw the sun shine high up above
He watched wild animals making love
So Noah waved at God and said
"If you really love me, flood the world again"

Oh oh oh
