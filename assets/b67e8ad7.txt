We’re Thinking the Same Thing
_____________________________

Mouthful of rain
You're holding your gun upside down
You're holding your wild ducks to the ground
You're counting every peanut you throw away
They take my head
Make it rain between your knees
And talk to the fire like a brother
And then we must lock the one door or the other
We're thinking the same thing

Too tired to steer
I am too tired to talk smart if you're just gonna dance
Too tired for these pants
And too fat to disappear
Too tired to love that cop on the street he sent down the other gatе
I'm too tired to taste your mouth
And we may stеp on the one frog or the other
But we're thinking the same thing

Baby horses on my chest are tryna push me out to sea
And you're doing the same
How quickly we forget
We're thinking the same thing
You and me got born on the same day that everybody gets
And our pools are as big as the corn fields
They stroke our hands and kiss our heel
And we make a surfboard living out into the ovens babe
Let's go California on all fours with nothing, babe
Lets pony away from the land of long discussions, babe
You already know how I feel
