Serious World
_____________

The unserious world is gone
Sweet Jesus
The unserious world is gone
Up into heaven it flew
Yeah the unserious world is gone, dear lord
And the serious world is gone, too
The fool in the corner is dead, hallelujah
The fool in the corner is dead
And the fool in the driveway is lost
Yeah the fool in the corner is dead, dear boy
As dead as the fool on the cross

Oh remind me lord, remind mе now
Remind me of your love
Oh rеmind me now
Remind me of your love

The unserious world is gone, hallelujah
The unserious world is gone
To be with the unserious lord
The unserious world is gone, dear boy
And the serious world was never even born

Oh remind, you gotta remind me now
Until you remind me of your love
Oh remind me now
Remind me of your love
